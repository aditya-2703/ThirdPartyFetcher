## ThirdParty Service

**Functionality:**

* Fetches repositories from a third-party service (e.g., GitHub).

**Components:**

* **ThirdParty API:** Acts as the interface for interacting with the external service.
* **ThirdParty Business Logic:** Handles the specific logic required to fetch, process, and manage data from the third-party service.
* **ThirdParty Repository:** Responsible for persisting and retrieving third-party data.
* **ThirdParty Resources:** Represents the data fetched from the third-party service (e.g., repositories).
* **ThirdParty Resources table:** A database table to store the fetched third-party data.

**Database:**

* **ThirdParty table:** Stores information about the third-party service itself (e.g., API key, service type).
* **ThirdParty Resources table:** Stores the fetched repositories, including metadata like name, description, and URL.

**Dependencies:**

* **Spring Boot:** Framework for building and deploying the service.
* **Spring Data JPA:** Provides a way to interact with the database for persistence.
* **GitHub Service:** Library or API client for communicating with the GitHub API. 

**Example Use Case:**

1. A user requests to link their GitHub account with the platform.
2. The ThirdParty API makes a request to the GitHub API to fetch the user's repositories.
3. The ThirdParty Business Logic processes the fetched data, extracting relevant information and formatting it for storage.
4. The ThirdParty Repository persists the processed data into the ThirdParty Resources table.
5. The application now has access to the user's GitHub repositories, which can be used for various features.

**Note:** The specific implementation details and components might vary depending on the chosen third-party service and its API.
